# Low Resolution Satellite Data Demo

This is a Jupyter notebook with a small set of demo data including a few bands of Sentinel-2 open source satellite imagery.  It is designed to demonstrate the basic concepts and methods of working with raster and vector spatial data, and is intended to help familiarise students with some of the most commonly used python tools for this sort of work.
